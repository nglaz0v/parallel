/* Define a data type consisting of a fixed number of 'buckets', each
 * containing a nonnegative integer value, which supports operations to:
 * - get the current value of any bucket
 * - remove a specified amount from one specified bucket and add it to
 *   another, preserving the total of all bucket values, and clamping
 *   the transferred amount to ensure the values remain non-negative
 * In order to exercise this data type, create one set of buckets, and
 * start three concurrent tasks:
 * - As often as possible, pick two buckets and make their values closer
 *   to equal.
 * - As often as possible, pick two buckets and arbitrarily redistribute
 *   their values.
 * - At whatever rate is convenient, display (by any means) the total
 *   value and, optionally, the individual values of each bucket.
 * The display task need not be explicit; use of e.g. a debugger or
 * trace tool is acceptable provided it is simple to set up to provide
 * the display.
 * This task is intended as an exercise in atomic operations. The sum of
 * the bucket values must be preserved even if the two tasks attempt to
 * perform transfers simultaneously, and a straightforward solution is
 * to ensure that at any time, only one transfer is actually occurring â€”
 * that the transfer operation is atomic.
